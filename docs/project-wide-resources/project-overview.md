Project UMG: Overview & Vision
1. The Core Mission: Building an Engine for Impact
This project is an endeavor to build a bespoke personal AI system designed to function as a persistent mentor, coach, teacher, assistant, and thought partner. It is born from the identity of a 0-to-1 Systems Builder—an individual driven to find chaotic environments and impose upon them elegant, scalable systems that unlock human potential.

The ultimate purpose of this system is not simply to optimize productivity, but to serve a life-defining mission: tackling the global water crisis through the vehicle of WaterOS. This project, therefore, is the infrastructure for a life's work. Its primary goal is to ensure that the user's most valuable and finite resource—their time and energy—is perpetually and rigorously aligned with their highest-impact goals.

2. The Problem: The Undocumented Meta-Layer
The user has already built exceptional systems for execution. A custom task management system, a business hub for WaterOS, and a CRM for tracking professional relationships all serve to manage the what and the how of the work.

The critical gap, however, is the "meta-layer": the rich, internal world of reasoning, reflection, strategic thinking, and decision-making that drives every action. This is the why. Currently, this data is undocumented and ephemeral.

The consequences of this gap are significant:

Context is Constantly Rebuilt: Without a persistent memory of past reasoning, context must be manually reconstructed for every new thought or conversation.

Patterns Remain Hidden: Insights from one domain (e.g., Willow Education) that could inform another (e.g., WaterOS) are left to fallible human memory to connect.

The Most Valuable Data is Lost: The rationale behind a key decision, the spark of a new idea, the nuance of a strategic pivot—this is the most valuable data the user generates, and it is currently being lost.

Traditional methods like journaling have proven ineffective due to their high friction. The solution must be seamlessly integrated into the user's existing workflows.

3. The Solution: A Unified Memory Graph (UMG)
The UMG is not merely a database; it is a living, evolving "second brain" or a personal "intelligence layer." It is designed to capture the undocumented meta-layer and turn it into a compounding asset. The system operates on a simple but powerful model: Pipes → Brain → Mentor.

Pipes (Frictionless Capture): The system will ingest data from a variety of sources to create a complete picture of the user's life. This includes active capture through voice notes and a global hotkey for quick text thoughts, as well as passive capture from APIs and webhooks connected to tools like GitHub, calendars (Granola), and Slack. The core principle is to capture everything first and filter for importance later, eliminating friction at the point of creation.

Brain (Intelligent Sense-Making): The "Archivist" agent acts as the system's librarian and sense-maker. It takes the messy, unstructured raw data from the pipes and transforms it into a structured, interconnected graph of knowledge. It identifies core concepts (like people, projects, and features) as central "hub" entities and links all related notes, tasks, and reflections to them as "spokes." This creates a rich, contextual web of memory.

Mentor (Proactive Insight): The "Mentor" agent is the primary user-facing intelligence. It reads from the structured memory graph built by the Archivist and acts as a proactive, challenging partner. Its job is not just to answer questions, but to ask them. It surfaces connections, identifies contradictions, checks for alignment with core values, and acts as a guardian against the "quiet misallocation of life's energy."

4. The Constitution: A System Built on Values
The UMG is not an impartial observer; it is an opinionated system governed by a clear constitution based on the user's core values:

Impact rooted in Equity

Innovation

Independence

Continuous Learning

This constitution is the bedrock of the Mentor's decision-making. Its ultimate directive is to filter all information and interactions through this lens.

Defining Success and Failure
The system is calibrated to the user's unique definitions:

Success is not personal wealth, but the creation of a self-sustaining engine of impact—specifically, WaterOS achieving "escape velocity" to solve a foundational inequity.

Failure is not a bankrupt startup, but the misallocation of one's life energy; remaining a capable operator on someone else's smaller mission instead of stepping fully into the visionary role required to tackle a world-scale problem.

5. The Vision: A Compounding Partner in Growth
This project is an asymmetric bet on the power of compounding self-knowledge. In the short term, it will solve the problem of the undocumented meta-layer. In the long term, it will become an invaluable partner.

Imagine a future where, before a critical investor meeting, the Mentor can provide a briefing that synthesizes not just CRM notes, but every related reflection, doubt, and strategic insight you've had over the past year. Imagine a system that can detect when your work patterns are drifting from your stated quarterly goals and proactively challenge you on it.

This is the vision for the UMG: a system that grows alongside you, building a memory that is both broad and deep, becoming the ultimate tool to help you test the upper limit of your extraordinary capacity for impact.
