# Mentor Chat Prompt Configuration
# Version: 1.0
# Last updated: 2025-11-08
#
# HOW VARIABLES WORK:
# The 'format' field in each section uses Python string formatting with curly braces.
# Available variables depend on the section type:
#
# Entity sections (core_identity, high_priority, active_work, relevant_entities):
#   - {title}         : Entity title
#   - {type}          : Entity type (e.g., "project", "person", "goal")
#   - {summary}       : Entity summary text
#   - {importance}    : Importance score (float, use :.2f for 2 decimal places)
#   - {recency}       : Recency score (float, use :.2f for 2 decimal places)
#
# Relationships section:
#   - {from_title}    : Title of the "from" entity
#   - {to_title}      : Title of the "to" entity
#   - {edge_kind}     : Type of relationship (e.g., "worked_on", "relates_to")
#
# Conversation history section:
#   - {role_label}    : "User" or "Mentor"
#   - {content}       : Message content
#   - {role}          : Raw role value ("user" or "assistant")
#
# Examples:
#   "- {title}: {summary}"                           → "- My Goal: Build a better system"
#   "- {title} ({type}, importance: {importance:.2f})" → "- UMG Project (project, importance: 0.85)"
#   "{from_title} --[{edge_kind}]--> {to_title}"     → "Ryan --[works_on]--> UMG Project"
